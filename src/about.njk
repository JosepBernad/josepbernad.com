    <p>
      <strong>Josep Bernad</strong> is a <strong>musician and DJ</strong> from <strong>Mallorca</strong> based in <strong>Barcelona</strong>, as well as a <strong>software engineer</strong> — a combination that allows him to merge advanced technology with creativity in all his productions. Trained from a young age as a <strong>drummer</strong> and later as a <strong>multi-instrumentalist</strong>, his personal project dives into <strong>electronic music</strong> — mainly <strong>House</strong> — blending contemporary digital textures with deep influences and an elegant sonic aesthetic. Working between Barcelona and Mallorca, he continues to expand his catalogue of original productions, always aiming to deliver a distinctive and solid musical experience.

      He presents three live formats: a <strong>Live Set</strong> featuring his own music performed with live instruments; a <strong>House DJ Set</strong> built around an extensive and carefully curated music library; and a <strong>Party Set (Open Format)</strong> designed for parties and festivals, where he mixes multiple genres while maintaining a coherent narrative and flawless transitions. On stage, he seeks <strong>emotional connection</strong> with the audience, real-time crowd reading, and precise technical execution. His influences include artists such as <strong>Fred Again..</strong>, <strong>Hernán Cattaneo</strong>, <strong>Safri Duo</strong>, <strong>Bellaire</strong>, <strong>Eric Prydz</strong>, and <strong>Parcels</strong>, among many others.
